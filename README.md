# The "10-50-500" Rule

> 1. 10: No package can have more than 10 classes.
> 2. 50: No method can have more than 50 lines of code.
> 3. 500: No class can have more than 500 lines of code.

DAMN!

# Milestone
Inspired by [30 Java Programming Tips and Best Practices for Beginners] article. I will make an algorithm which will check if **10-50-500 Rule** was broken for given ~~Java~~ Maven project

# TODOs
1. [x] Raw code provider (for SLOC counting)
2. [x] Package explorer (to know the number and location of classes for each package)
3. [ ] Methods detector (for counting lines of code inside methods)
4. [ ] Main script which will check the *10*, *50* and *500* conditions

# Stay tuned folks
